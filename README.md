🐱🐶 Cats vs Dogs Image Classifier (CNN)

A deep learning project that classifies images of cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras. The model integrates Batch Normalization and Dropout layers to enhance accuracy and reduce overfitting.

This project aims to accurately classify images as cats or dogs using a convolutional neural network trained on image data.
The network architecture utilizes Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, BatchNormalization, and Dropout layers to achieve balanced performance and generalization.

Test Accuracy 80.72%
